# PHP-LOOP-CHALLENGE
Challenge 2: For this Challenge you are going to make a group of people with different attributes.  Firstly make 4 arrays of 5 items each. The first array should contain names, the second hair colours, the third age and the fourth height. Then using loops you're going to create 5 people out of those arrays, each person taking one attribute from each. Each person should be a new array. Then you are going to add those 5 people arrays to a larger array called 'class' Lastly loop through 'class' and output each person's name followed by their other attributes with each person on a new line.
