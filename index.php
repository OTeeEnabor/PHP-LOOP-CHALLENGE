Challenge 2:
For this Challenge you are going to make a group of people with different attributes.
Firstly make 4 arrays of 5 items each.
The first array should contain names, the second hair colours, the third age and the fourth height.
Then using loops you're going to create 5 people out of those arrays, each person taking one attribute from each. Each person should be a new array.
Then you are going to add those 5 people arrays to a larger array called 'class'
Lastly loop through 'class' and output each person's name followed by their other attributes with each person on a new line.

$name = array('Jody','Eugene','Yusuf','Ola','Abdi');
$color = array('orange','brown','blue','blonde','black');
$age = array(20,25,20,22,23);
$height = array('187cm','198cm','189cm','188cm','187cm');
